In the following prompt:
Schema File = [SCHEMA FILE]

Add the following fields to Schema File:
-image1: imageAsset, required
-image2: imageAsset, required
-title
-description (use getRichTextFields - see implementation on the richTextSection.ts schema file. only add link and strong)

Populate its corresponing fragment, type and tsx file with the new data. Follow examples from other sections in web/src/sections. The TSX file can just have these fields added to the props with a console log, logging everything but dont change anything about the return value
